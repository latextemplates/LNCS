%"runningheads" enables:
%  - page number on page 2 onwards
%  - title/authors on even/odd pages
%This is good for other readers to enable proper archiving among other papers and pointing to content.
%Even if the title page states the title, when printed and stored in a folder, when blindly opening the folder, one could hit not the title page, but an arbitrary page. Therefore, it is good to have title printed on the pages, too.

cref Demonstration: Cref at beginning of sentence, cref in all other cases.

\Cref{fig:simple} shows a simple fact, although \cref{fig:simple} could also show something else.

``something in quotes'' using plain tex or use \enquote{the enquote command}.

You can now write words containing hyphens which are hyphenated (application"=specific) at other places.
This is enabled by an additional configuration of the babel package.
In case you write \enquote{application-specific}, then the word will only be hyphenated at the dash.
You can also write applica\allowbreak{}tion-specific, but this is much more effort.

In the bibliography, use \texttt{\textbackslash textsuperscript} for ``st'', ``nd'', ...:
E.g., \enquote{The 2\textsuperscript{nd} conference on examples}.
When you use \href{https://www.jabref.org}{JabRef}, you can use the clean up command to achieve that.
See \url{https://help.jabref.org/en/CleanupEntries} for an overview of the cleanup functionality.
