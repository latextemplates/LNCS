## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `.aspell.en.pws` and `.aspell.conf` to ignore some LaTeX commands at aspell.
- When using lualatex: Added support for [spelling](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/spelling) package (which highlights bad spellings in red - if `.spell.bad` containing misspelled words exists)

### Fixed

### Changed

- Refined `Makefile`

## [2025-01-14]

### Changed

- Compilation with both lualatex and pdflatex is possible. Defaults to lualatex.
- Nicer gray scale for `minted` listings.
- `Dockerfile` switched to [Island of TeX's docker image](https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texlive#tex-live-docker-image) to enable easy addition of new LaTeX packages.

## [2022-06-06]

### Added

- Magic comment for [LTeX](https://github.com/valentjn/vscode-ltex#ltex-extension-for-vs-code-grammarspell-checker-using-languagetool-with-support-for-latex-markdown-and-others) (because of [vscode-ltex#632](https://github.com/valentjn/vscode-ltex/issues/632))

### Changed

- Refined description of usage of [llncsconf](https://ctan.org/pkg/llncsconf) package.
- Update `splncsnat` to [splncs04nat](https://github.com/tpavlic/splncs04nat). [lncs#35](https://github.com/latextemplates/LNCS/issues/35)
- `_latexmkrc` is available instead of `latexmkrc` to ease usage at overleaf. [lncs#40](https://github.com/latextemplates/LNCS/issues/40)

- Now generated using the [latex template generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-latex-template).
- Replaced `\ifluatex` statements by separate `.tex` documents. This makes each `.tex` document smaller and simpler to understand.

- Updated to TeXLive 2021

### Added

- Added initial `Dockerfile` to enable building using Docker.
