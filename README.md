# Simplified LNCS Template

> Quick start for modern LaTeXing with [LNCS](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs).

## Usage

- `paper.tex` is the main document
- Use "lualatex + bibtex" in your TeX editor or `latexmk  paper` / `make` in the command line

### Using `latexmk`

[latexmk] is a very smart tool for latex compilation.
It executes the latex tools as often as needed to get the final PDF.

To build the whole document, execute following command.
Note that this requires a working perl installation.

```bash
latexmk paper
```

To enable latexmk, please move `_latexmkrc` to `latexmkrc`.

In case something goes wrong, you can instruct the LaTeX compiler to stop at the first error:

```bash
lualatex paper
```

### Advanced usage

On the command line, there are additional features:

- `latexmk -C` or `make clean` for cleaning up
- `make format` to reformat the `.tex` files (one sentence per line and indent)
- `make aspell` for interactive spell checking
- `make stand`: Creates a new PDF with the current status of the thesis.
- `make view`: Opens the configured viewer
- `make mrproper`: Cleans up and removes also editor backup files.

## Benefits

Following features are enabled in this template:

- Provides a skeletal [paper.tex](paper.tex) file
- Example to have an image being placed right to a text
- Support for German documents (without broken headers):
  Contains a fix to increase compatibility with Babel.
  See <https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/441701/9075> for details.
- Automatic setting of "Fig." and "Section"/"Sect." according to the LNCS style.
  Just use `\Cref{sec:xy}` at the beginning of a sentence and `\cref{sec:xy}` in the middle of a sentence.
  Thanx to [cleveref].
- Sharper font (still compatible with Springer's requirements).
- (Optional) Typesetting of listings using advanced highlighting powered by the [minted] package.
- Generated PDF allows for copy and paste of text without getting words with ligatures such as "workflow" destroyed.
  This is enabled by `glyphtounicode`, which encodes ligatures (such as fl) using unicode characters.
- Support of hyperlinked references without extra color thanx to [hyperref].
- Better breaking of long URLs.
- Support for `\powerset` command.
- (Optional) Support todos as pdf annotations. This is enabled by the [pdfcomment] package.
- [microtypographic extensions](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/microtype) for a better look of the paper.
- Modern packages such as [microtype], [cleveref], [csquotes], [hyperref], [hypcap], [upquote], [natbib], [booktabs].
- (Optional) LaTeX compilation using the modern lualatex compiler.
- [latexmk] for easy compilation of the LaTeX document.
- Ready-to-go configuration for [latexindent].
- Proper hyphenation and microtype for English texts.

## Disabled features

Following features were not activated for this template.
You can run the [latex template generator] to enable the features.

Hints on writing an abstract and thesis by Dirk Fahland.

There is currently no official biblatex support.
A first step towards that is done at [biblatex-lncs](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-lncs).

## Examples

- [paper.pdf](https://latextemplates.github.io/LNCS/paper.pdf) - normal paper.
- [paper-minted.pdf](https://latextemplates.github.io/LNCS/paper-minted.pdf) - paper showing minted in action.
- [paper-newtx.pdf](http://latextemplates.github.io/LNCS/paper-newtx.pdf) - paper typeset in Times Roman to save some space.
- [paper-minted-newtx.pdf](http://latextemplates.github.io/LNCS/paper-minted-newtx.pdf) - paper typeset in Times Roman to save some space.

## Background

The official template is available at <https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines> --> "Templates, samples files & useful links" --> "LaTeX2e Proceedings Templates (zip)"

## Quick start

- Click on `Download ZIP` or [here](https://github.com/latextemplates/LNCS/archive/main.zip).
- Extract `LNCS-main.zip` in the folder where you want to write your paper.
- Edit [paper.tex](paper.tex).
- `latexmk paper`.

When using on overleaf, you have to switch Overleaf to use TeXLive 2024 (or later).

As you see on GitHub actions, the paper compiles out of the box.
There is no need to adjust the packages or to remove some of them.
This might lead to undesired results such as hyperlinks not working any more or no good microtypographic features.
In case you think, a package needs to be altered or added, feel free to open an issue.

## Tool hints

### Prerequisites

- Windows: Recent [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/). MiKTeX installation hints are given at <http://latextemplates.github.io/scientific-thesis-template/#installation-hints-for-windows>.
- Mac OS X: Recent [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (e.g. through [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/)) - Try `sudo tlmgr update --all` if you encounter issues with biblatex
- Linux: Recent TeX Live distribution

### Usage of `minted`

To have minted running properly, you have to do following steps on Windows:

1. Install python: `choco install python` - that uses [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install Python
2. Install [pygments]: `pip instal pygments` - that uses the Pyhton package manager to install the pygments library
3. When latexing, use `-shell-escape`: `pdflatex -shell-escape paper`.
   You can also just execute `latexmk paper`.

### VSCode configuration

Currently, following extensionsa re recommended:

- [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) to support LaTeX in VSCode and
- [LaTeX Utilities](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tecosaur.latex-utilities) to enhance LaTeX Workshop
- [LTeX+] to have a nice spell checker that also identifies grammar issues

Then, change the setting of LaTeX Workshop to use biber:
Update the following lines in the VSCode `settings.json` to contain:

```javascript
    "latex-workshop.latex.recipes": [
        {
            "name": "lualatex âžž bibtex âžž lualatexâ€ŠÃ—â€Š2 ðŸ”ƒ",
            "tools": [
                "lualatex",
                "bibtex",
                "lualatex",
                "lualatex"
            ]
        },
    ],
    "latex-workshop.latex.tools": [
        // ...
        {
            "name": "bibtex",
            "command": "bibtex",
            "args": [
                "%DOCFILE%"
            ],
            "env": {}
        },
        // ...
    ],
```

The following settings are additionally recommended:

```javascript
{
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",                              // enable soft line breaks
    "latex-workshop.view.pdf.viewer": "tab",              // display the generaded PDF in a separate tab
    "latex-workshop.view.pdf.backgroundColor": "#cccccc", // use a darker background in de PDF viewer to lift of the pages from it
    "latex-workshop.latex.autoBuild.run": "onSave",       // automatically build on saving .tex files
    "editor.renderWhitespace": "all",                     // display all whitespaces
}
```

Alternatively, just copy and paste the contents of the [vscode.settings.json](./vscode.settings.json) file to your VSCode settings file.

### LTeX+ tips and tricks

[LTeX+] is an offline grammar and spell checker with support for LaTeX and Markdown.

Add a magic comment to your files to tell LTeX+ which language to use:

```latex
% LTeX: language=de-DE
```

If you want to use different languages in the text, use the `\foreignlanguage{language}{text}` command.
LTeX+ will detect these elements and automatically switch the spell checker's language.
For example:

```latex
\foreignlanguage{english}{Therefore, our proposed approach will change the world.}
```

### Other hints

- Grammar and spell checking is available at [TeXstudio].
  Please download [LanguageTool] (Windows: `choco install languagetool`) and [configure TeXstudio to use it](http://wiki.languagetool.org/checking-la-tex-with-languagetool#toc4).
  Note that it is enough to point to `languagetool.jar`.
  **If TeXstudio doesn't fit your need, check [the list of all available LaTeX Editors](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/339/latex-editors-ides).**
- Use [JabRef] to manage your bibliography (Windows: `choco install jabref`).

## Usage with docker

The generated `Dockerfile` is based on the [Dockerfile by the Island of TeX](https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texlive#tex-live-docker-image).

```cmd
docker run --rm -v "c:\users\example\latex-document:/workdir" ltg latexmk
```

Following one-time setup is required:

```cmd
docker build -t ltg .
```


## Contained Directories and Files

### Directories

- [figures](graphics/) Directory containing the figures.
  By using LuaLaTex/PDFLaTeX it is possible to use PDFs, JPGs, PNGs, ... We recommend to use PDFs to enable smooth scaling.

### Files

- `paper.tex` - The main `.tex` file loading all LaTeX packages and their configurations.
  - Add text here
  - Adjust title etc. here
- [bibliography.bib](bibliography.bib) - Bibliography. [biblatex] format. Manage it with [JabRef].
- [abbreviations.tex](abbreviations.tex) - Acronyms and abbreviations.
- [commands.tex](commands.tex) - Example LaTeX macros.

Following additional files are included, which do not need to be adapted:

- [localSettings.yaml](localSettings.yaml) - Settings for [latexindent](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexindent)
- [Makefile](Makefile) - The Makefile. Builds on latexmk.
- [Texlivefile](Texlivefile) - List of packages required for a minimal TeXLive installation.

## FAQs

### Q: Overleaf outputs a warning regarding the llncs class

Overleaf might output following warning:

> LaTeX Warning: You have requested, on input line 8, version
> 2018/03/10' of document class llncs, but only version 2004/08/17 v2.14
> LaTeX document class for Lecture Notes in Computer Science'
> is available.

The reason is that you did not use `llncs.cls` (included in your LaTeX distribution).
Please remove the file and update your LaTeX distribution.

### Q: How can I synchronize updates from the template to my repository?

1. Initialize your git repository as usual
2. Add this repository as upstream: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/latextemplates/{template}.git`
3. Merge the branch `upstream/main` into your `main` branch: `git merge upstream/main`.

After that you can use and push the `main` branch as usual.
Notes on syncing with the upstream repository [are available from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).

### Q: I get the error `! pdfTeX error (font expansion): auto expansion is only possible with scalable fonts.`

Install the `cm-super` package using the MiKTeX package manager. Then, run `initexmf --mkmaps` on the command line. (Long description: <https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/324972/9075>)

### Q: I get `Package csquotes Error: Unbalanced groups or invalid nesting.` What can I do?

A: You have activated `\MakeOuterQuote{"}` and used some special babel command to allow hyphenation at other places as a dash. One example is writing `application"=specific`.
Now, you have to decide whether you want keep using plain quotes to enquote a word or use the special hyphenation command.
In other words: Do you want `"quote"` and `app\-lication\-specific` or `\enquote{quote} and  application"=specific`?

Note that this should not happen when the template is generated as the setting `tweakouterquote` ensures that these two options are mutually exclusive.

### Q: I need more space. What can I do?

The most simple solution to get more space is to exchange the font.

### Q: How can I reformat my `.tex` files?

Execute `latexindent -l -s -sl -w paper.tex`

Alternatively, execute `make format`.

### Q: How I want to obey the one-sentence-per-line rule. How to do?

See "How can I reformat my `.tex` files?"

### Q: I want to use minted, because I think its syntax highlighting seems to be better.

You can re-generate the template and choose `minted` as listings environment.
Moreover, ensure that python and [pygments](https://pygments.org/) are installed properly:

- `choco install python`
- `pip install pygments`

### Q: Is it possible to have a footer indicating that the paper is intended to be submitted/submitted/published?

Activate the `llncsconf` package.
The possible options are listed in `paper.tex`.

### Q: Can I also write in German?

Yes. You can regenerate the template and choose "German" as language.

### Q: `ngerman-x-latest` is reported missing

Install the package `dehyph-exptl`.

### Q: I get ``! I can't find file `clmr28t10+20'.``

You seem to use `latexmk` locally.
Please move `_latexmkrc` to `latexmkrc` to get `latexmk` working.
If you don't do this, `latexmk` tries to execute `latex`, which tries to produce a DVI file (and not a PDF file).

### Q: I get `Font "LatinModernMath-Regular" not found.`. What can I do?

Error message:

```text
luaotfload | db : Reload initiated (formats: otf,ttf,ttc); reason: Font "LatinModernMath-Regular" not found.
luaotfload | resolve : sequence of 3 lookups yielded nothing appropriate.

! Package fontspec Error: The font "LatinModernMath-Regular" cannot be found.
```

Install the package `lm-math` manually.

### Q: I get `! Package fontspec Error: The font "TeXGyreTermes" cannot be found.`. What can I do?

Install the package `tex-gyre` and `tex-gyre-math` manually.

### Q: I get `! error:  (type 1): cannot find encoding file 'ntx-ot1-tlf.enc' for reading`. What can I do?

See <https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/240850/9075>: Install the packages `newpx` and `newtxsf` manually.

### Q: I get `! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [main memory size=3000000].`. What can I do?

Follow the steps at <https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/548335/9075>

Try with following command

```bash
lualatex -shell-escape --extra-mem-top=10000000 --synctex=1 paper.tex
```

See <https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/124206/9075> for details.
